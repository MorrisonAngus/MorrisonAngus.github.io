      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Sinclair Interplanetary by Rocket Lab, January 2022 - August 2022</h3>
      <p>While employed by Sinclair Interplanetary, I used Python to develop graphical user<br> 
         interfaces, which were implemented into the production pipeline to assist with the testing<br>
         and production of star-trackers and reaction wheels.<br><br>
        
         I also assisted in the development and testing of a new Python package<br>
         which was developed for in-house use, and was designed to communicate with the<br>
         hardware. Additionally, I explored a new micro-processor and engaged with the<br>
         pins to analyze how to replace the current hardware with this new version.</p>

      <h3>Canadian Armed Forces (Civilian Employee), May 2021 - September 2021</h3>
      <p>While working for the Canadian Armed Forces, I was in charge of busissness<br>
         requirements gathering for the development of a new system. This system was<br>
         intended to be a web application and as such I was also given the responsibility<br>
         of creating wireframe outlines for each of the pagees using the balsamiq online tool.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies, Interest, and Achevements</h2>
      <p>Throughout my life I have always been interested in coding and creating my own programs<br>
         The other pages on this site include a few example projects that I have created showing my<br>
         my skills with the technologies listed on each page.<br><br>
        
         I am also passionate about staying active. I ride my bike to school/work whenever I can<br>
         and I have completed five half marathons. I have placed first in rowing regattas and<br>
         participated in a outdoor integration program in my education. I am also part of the archery<br>
         team at uvic.</p>
