      <h2>Work Experience</h2>
      <h3>Sinclair Interplanetary by Rocket Lab, January 2022 - August 2022</h3>
      <p>While employed by Sinclair Interplanetary, I used Python to develop graphical user
         interfaces, which were implemented into the production pipeline to assist with the testing
         and production of star-trackers and reaction wheels.<br><br>
        
         I also assisted in the development and testing of a new Python package
         which was developed for in-house use, and was designed to communicate with the
         hardware. Additionally, I explored a new micro-processor and engaged with the
         pins to analyze how to replace the current hardware with this new version.</p>

      <h3>Canadian Armed Forces (Civilian Employee), May 2021 - September 2021</h3>
      <p>While working for the Canadian Armed Forces, I was in charge of busissness requirements
         gathering for the development of a new system. This system was intended to be a web
         application and as such I was also given the responsibility of creating wireframe outlines
         for each of the pagees using the balsamiq online tool.</p>

      <h2>Hobbies, Interest, and Achevements</h2>
