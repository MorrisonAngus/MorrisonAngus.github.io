        <h2>Education</h2>
        <p>Enrolled in the Bachelor of Engineering at University of Victoria<br>
           Fifth year 2023 - 2024, SEng specialization</p>
        <h2>Work Experience</h2>
        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 0">Sinclair Interplanetary by Rocket Lab, January 2022 - August 2022</h3>
        <p>While employeed by Sinclair Interplanetary I used python to develop graphical user<br> 
           interfaces which were implemented into the production pipeline to assist with the testing<br>
           and production of star-trackers and reaction wheels.<br><br>
          
           I also assisted in the development and testing of a new python package<br>
           which was debeloped for in house use, and was designed to communicate with the<br>
           hardware. Additionally I explored a new micro-processor and engaged with the<br>
           pins to analyze how to replace the current hardware with this new version.</p>
